Conway's game of life implemented in JavaScript. Mainly to learn a bit of javascript but who doesn't like creating turing complete emergent phenomenon with a few simple rules. 

To Do:
Figure out how to scale canvas and work on the image data buffer directly instead of having a separate array for state.
Make a dynamic grid which extends out, instead of treating edge cases as 0 neighbours.
